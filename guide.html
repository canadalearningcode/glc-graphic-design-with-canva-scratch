        #Introduction

        ##Kick-Off Script

        Welcome to our Girls Learning Code workshop: Graphic Design with Canva! We’re so glad that you could be here today and hope you’re ready to learn lots of new things.

        How many of you have been to one of our workshops or camps before?
        (If you get some hands up, ask a few of them what workshops they attended)

        We started running our first programs for kids with Girls Learning Code workshops and camps back in 2012, and then since we had so many people asking if boys could come too we started Kids Learning Code a year later in 2013. Since then, we’ve expanded to over 29 cities across Canada and have taught over 19,000 kids how to code!

        Before we get started with our workshop, there are a few things we need to go over:

        * <strong>Washrooms:</strong> Can everyone please point in the direction of the washrooms? (clarify where they are located) If you need to go to the washroom, please bring a buddy with you.
        * <strong>Water:</strong> If you brought a water bottle with you, you’re welcome to keep it on your desk, but make sure to keep the lid closed when you’re not using it. If you don’t have a water bottle, one of our mentors can help grab a glass from the kitchen later on (but please keep glasses away from laptops).
        * <strong>Break/snacks:</strong> We’ll have a 10 minute break when you can eat any snacks you brought with you or just stretch your legs. If you have a (peanut free) snack, please eat it out front and clean up any crumbs or wrappers when you’re done.

        ##Intro Slides

        ![notes](framework/img/workshop/gd-notes.png)

        <br>
        #Follow-Along

        * Show learners how to open up Canva and log in (slide #27)
        * Click on the green “Create a Design” button to get started
        * Select the poster design (e.g.) for your example project
        * Have learners do the same, and rename their project (Click on the title to rename)
        * Demonstrate how to use each tab: Background, Text, Elements, Uploads
        * Encourage learners to create their own designs, but show them the Layouts tab for inspiration
        * Optional: Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AIA07gcJAQBRyGMDSSIMkDMhcKucyVD7dsobT-Y46Co/edit?usp=sharing">Follow-Along in Canva</a> document for extra support


        <br>
        #Work Session

        ##Ages 6-8 + parents

        * Select 2-3 projects from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cNmFTqK3wGKassUwwBAfuzKgMsc5ShxeTCpU_WnzeCw/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activities: Card, Gift tag, Gift wrap. (Optional: Choose a theme)
        * For each project, start by showing an example and point out the main features.
        * Begin by creating a new project. For each activity, show learners where to find the design type in Canva.
        * Remind learners to rename their project right away.
        * Give learners time to work on their designs. Refer to Solution Sheets, as needed.
        * Show learners how to share their projects (Side #33) and remind them to do so after finishing each project.
        * Canva saves projects automatically, but select “File” > “Save” before exiting the design to be safe.
        * Each activity should take 10-15 minutes. Add additional activities from the list, as needed.
        * Leave time for DEMOS at the end of the workshop, where learners come to the front and show off their work. To save time, you can also have a Gallery Walk, where learners open their favourite designs on their screens, tuck in their chairs, and walk around to see each other's work.


        If learners and parent/guardians are sharing a laptop, it might be helpful to clarify roles during the activities. For example, have parents/guardians point at elements they like on the screen, while learners add them into the design.  Ideally, the learner is in charge of navigating and completing tasks on the computer, while the parent supports them.

        ##Ages 9-12

        * Select 3-4 projects from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cNmFTqK3wGKassUwwBAfuzKgMsc5ShxeTCpU_WnzeCw/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activities: Instagram post, Card, Snapchat geofilter, Gift wrap. (Optional: Choose a theme)
        * For each project, start by showing an example and point out the main features.
        * Begin by creating a new project. For each activity, show learners where to find the design type in Canva.
        * Remind learners to rename their project right away.
        * Give learners time to work on their designs. Refer to Solution Sheets, as needed.

        <br>
        #Unplugged Activity (Optional)

        If you notice that the group is needing a break, give them 10 minutes to use the washroom, get some water, or grab a snack from their bags. Another option is to run an unplugged activity midway through the workshop to get them out of their seats and moving around. Unplugged activities usually take around 10 minutes to run. Choose an unplugged activity from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tUTiHl7scs8RHdLLvdmZTFtD9EuAyZhetTLFgvar5CQ/edit?usp=sharing">activity list</a>. Suggested activity: Do The Robot.

        <br>
        #Closing Script

        Who can tell me something new they learned today? (<strong>*Refer to slide 35 for examples</strong>. If you don’t get any hands up, you can either ask a specific kid that was definitely engaged during the workshop, or review a couple of the key lessons in the workshop)

        You all did an amazing job and we’re really impressed with how great your projects turned out.

        If you want to learn more about coding, design, and technology, go onto our site girlslearningcode.com to check out all of our upcoming workshops and join our mailing list. (Announce next workshop and give short description).

        Before we go, let’s give our mentors a big hand!

        Thanks and we hope to see you all in another workshop soon!
